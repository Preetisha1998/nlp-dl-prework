### Project Overview

 Pridiction of  the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that we can budget it from our revenue. 
The dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Our aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set. 
The dataset has details of 12261 lego sets with the following 10 features.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I understood how to build a linear regression model. The concepts applied were:
Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Linear Regression
MSE and R^2 Evaluation Metrics
